		<h2 class="center">About ARFNET</h2>
		<div class="div">
			<p>
			ARFNET is a LAN of hosts providing services to the public in the classic way, like this website itself.
			Some of the services are for my own use, some others are public, for friends or everyone to use them, for example,
			/FTPServer is the general directory for sharing random stuff.
			But ARFNET didn't start like it is today, in the begining this was just me opening random ports. Now is (mostly) well organised and administrated. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			A little bit of history now. A long time ago, several years back, I downloaded Apache HTTP Server in my shitty Pentium PC (the first host), and opened port 80 in my router.
			That is the origin. But I wanted more, I got a FreeDNS domain, the former arf20.mooo.com, and made a HTTPS certificate. Also installed Bitvise SSH server for remote management,
			with public key authentication, and allowed my NIC to wake the PC with Wake-on-LAN, to have it always available. But this wasn't a very good way of hosting a website, is not 24/7.
			I had a little Raspberry Pi 2B (<i>raspi</i>, which is still alive serving PPTP 24/7. But a raspi is not beefy enough to run nginx and to have a big drive. So, the waiting
			has paid off, and in summer 2021 I got my first real thicc and beautiful enterprise server. A DELL PowerEdge R720, which I inmediately bricked. You are not warned of the
			<i>special update process</i> that iDRAC needs, so I just tried updating to the last version, which went wrong. So wrong that iDRAC cound't be reflashed again. The only
			thing that I could do is change the motherboard, but that is even more expensive than another server. Another server? I still got eBay 1 month return warranty,
			so I applied it. Told the seller <i>"iDRAC broke itself lol"</i>, somehow they accepted. I got my 300â‚¬ back, and bought another R720, with better CPU! So I popped the boot drive,
			for which I choosed Ubuntu Server, and HDD from the old server, and it was almost plug-and-play. ARFNET back in business! From that point on, I have been migrating more services
			to the server, and adding new ones, like NTP and DNS. Now, my workstation is so linked to the server with SMB mounts that it is useless without it :concern:. I'll be more careful.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			And what will the future hold? Well, the future is not written, but I got a few ideas. Like a 10gig upgrade, but not the whole network, that would be just too expensive.
			Just a 10GBASE-SR link, between the server and desktop, to make it even more linked together, with SATA speeds network shares. Both with their respectible 1000BASE-T links to
			the router. Thats slight fantasy, for now, I'm looking on getting a wood rack cabinet built, in which to hold the server. And hopefully, send vodafone (ISP) to crap, and get a
			new, better ISP, with better service, and a fiber backbone. Probably with 600/600 speed. Because how fiber is installed, with a fiber to RJ45 box, I can actually choose my own
			router! Obviously a rackmounted Mikrotik, since I'll have rack. No more ISP shit hardware in my network. And to fill the rest of the space in the rack, I can pop in a big 24 port
			gigabit managed switch from D-Link, with a link to the router, as a centralised hub for everything, and nicely organised with a patch panel. I know single points of failure, but
			not having them is expensive. I could also get a rackmounted KVM console, one of the coolest things for a rack. Maybe with a KVM switch for future servers? And to fill the bottom,
			a 2U UPS, and a drawer.
